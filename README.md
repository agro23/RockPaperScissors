# Rock Paper Scissors

#### By Andy Grossberg

## Description
A program for two players to play Rock Paper Scissors.

## Rules

* Recreate the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. For anyone who has never played it, here are the rules:

* It is played by 2 people. Each person chooses "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors" by forming a shape with their hand.

* They choose at the same time, so that each person doesn't know what the other person has picked.

* If one person chooses "Rock" and the other person picks "Scissors" then "Rock" wins. It's a game of combinations:
  - Rock v. Scissors = Rock wins
  - Rock v. Paper = Paper wins
  - Paper v. Scissors = Scissors wins

* If both people choose the same thing, then it is a draw and nobody wins.

* Write a method that can handle the different combinations of plays and make sure to write specs for all possible combination of plays. Your method should take 2 inputs - one for each player's choice. It should return "Player 1" if the first input wins, "Player 2" if the second input wins, and "Draw" if nobody wins.

* Start by considering all possible inputs and outputs. Then choose the simplest input/output values and use them to write your first spec. Write all specs in english first, and then translate them into test methods and make them pass, one by one. Don't start coding until you've written your english specs, and don't start building the MVC website until all your specs are passing and your method is done.

* Then, build a website, styled with CSS, where someone can go to play your game. Make sure you include a README for this project and create a Git repository for it.

* Bonus points: Find a way to get the computer to randomly select a 'play' and make your website into a one player game. We don't yet know how to test something that's random, so it's okay to skip writing a spec for that part. Or, you could expand the rules of your game to include 3 players. Make sure to write specs for that before coding. You must understand your goal clearly before you can figure out how to get there.
